## Description

A lack of user input back-end sanitization allows remote attackers to perform a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack in Gestsup < 3.2.46.

When creating or editing a ticket, an unprivileged user is able to intercept and edit the `Description` and `Resolution` fields directly in the request to bypass front-end sanitization and store malicious HTML content.


## Impact

An unprivileged user is then able to execute script on any user's browser who are viewing the malicious ticket. Combined with [CVE-???-????](../CVE-???-????%20(CSRF)/README.md), it can be used to take over privileged accounts.
