## Description

A lack of CSRF protection in the request to edit a user's profile information in Gestsup < 3.2.46 allows attackers to perform a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack.

The `index.php?page=admin/user&action=edit&userid=1&tab=infos` endpoint can be exploited to craft a malicious request which can be used to trick users into unknowingly changing their information, including email address and password.


## Impact

An attacker could trick another user into unknowingly changing their password when visiting a malicious website. 

Combined with [CVE-2023-52059](../CVE-2023-52059/README.md), it can be used to take over privileged accounts.
